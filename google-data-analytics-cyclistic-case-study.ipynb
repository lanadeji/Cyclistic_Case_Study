Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, the team believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. Casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Business Task\nDesign marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

Act\n#### Key Findings\nCasual riders ride nearly 50% longer than members on average\nAnnual members mainly use the bikes for their commutes as their usage peaks on weekdays during rush hour\nCasual riders use the bikes more for leisure based on the peak usage in summer months and weekends\nCasual riders do not use the service during the winter months as much as annual members\nAnnual members mainly use classic bikes and rarely use docked bikes but casual riders are more open to riding all kinds of bikes\n\nThe average ride duration is higher for casual riders for any day of the week.\n\n• Both members and casual riders preferred docked bikes, while the classic bike is the least popular bike type.\n\n• Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, and Millennium Park are casual riders’ top three start stations.\n\n• Casual riders ride more during the weekends.\n\n### Recommendations\n• Giving incentives or rewards for achieving members’ milestones to attract casual riders to become members.\n\n• Offer occasional membership discount to new riders on summer and holiday weekends\n\n• Partner with local businesses within the top used stations for casual riders targeting 1) local casual riders, 2) frequent visitors (commuters) to the businesses.\nRun promotions for annual memberships during the winter months to boost sales and try to convert casual riders into annual members\nDecrease the price of single-fare and full-day passes Monday through Friday to bolster casual ridership during the work week\nIncrease price of single-fare and full-day passes on Saturday and Sunday to entice customers to convert from casual ridership into annual membership","metadata":{}}]}
